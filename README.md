This is my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages, "built" with Bootstrap, and filled with Jupyter Notebooks 
related to cheminformatics and computational chemistry. 

I was originally an organic chemist in medicinal chemistry, but through the generosity of many members of this community, 
I was able to find a fulfilling career in cheminformatics/computational chemistry! And now I'd like to give back to this 
community by sharing my own learnings and hopefully bridging the gap between "okay I know a little bit of Python but how do 
I apply computer science to chemistry" and "I want to solve a tricky cheminformatic problem, how have other practitioners
solved it before me.

I hope you enjoy reading my work and hopefully you learn something new while doing so!
